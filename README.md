# My Personal Project

## The Reading Room

For the personal project I have decided to make a GUI represented virtual bookshelf application called
***The Reading Room***. This is an application to keep track of the books you've read, you can store books
 with the author's name, and add some notes along with the books you store, there will also be a search feature and
the books can also be sorted alphabetically.

I've always loved reading books, and I've always wanted an application
which could keep track of the books I read and also the note adding feature 
is really great as I can just refer back to those notes in future instead 
of going through the trouble of rereading the whole book.



User stories:
- 
- As a user, I can add and remove Books from the bookshelf.
- As a user, I can search for books in my bookshelf.
- As a user, I have the ability to add and edit the summary of the books I've read.
- As a user, I can view all the books on my Bookshelf in order to see all the books I own.
- As a user, I have the option to sort my books by their titles.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the books in my bookshelf to file, if I wish to do so.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my saved bookshelf from file, if I choose so.
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple Books to a Bookshelf.


### Instructions for Grader:

- you click the button labelled "Add Book" to add a book to the bookshelf. 
- you can view all the books in the bookshelf by clicking on the 'view bookshelf' button.
- you can delete a book from the bookshelf by clicking the 'delete Book' button.
- you click the button labelled "Sort Books" to sort the books by name and present a list of books in the bookshelf.
- visual component - A background image of a bookshelf.
- you can save the application by, clicking on the save button to save the state of the application file.
- you can load the application by, clicking the 'yes' button on 
 the pop-up(which appears when the code is run) asking whether the user wishes to load the data.

Phase 4: Task 2

Book added to shelf: jnk`

Book added to shelf: p`

Book removed from the shelf:wsljnw`

PHASE 4: TASK 3

If I had more time I would add an iterator in bookshelf. It would make my code more flexible.
Iterators provide a convenient and efficient way to traverse collections, without exposing the internal structure or
requiring the entire collection to be loaded into memory.
